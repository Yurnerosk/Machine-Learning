Few machine learning algorithm examples

In here you'll find various machine learning exercises found around the internet. I do not own them.

## Gradient Descent
In this example, we have a training set containing sales and spendings with media.

(Gradient Descent is not a ML algorithm, but a solver for function minimization).

The model is then trained with a training set containing 200 observations, each labeled as $(Spendings_i , Sales_i)$. The objective of this training is to create a linear model (**linear regression**), that looks like something like this:

$$ f(x) = wx + b $$

notice that the optimal values for **w** and **b** are yet to be found, and to do that we must look for two values that minimize a **loss function**, the mean squared error **l**:

$$ l = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left( y_i - \left( wx_i + b \right) \right)^2 $$

Gradient Descent starts with calculating the partial derivative for every parameter:

$$\frac{\partial l}{\partial w} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} 2\left( y_i - \left( wx_i + b \right) \right)*\left( -xi \right)$$

$$\frac{\partial l}{\partial b} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} 2\left( y_i - \left( wx_i + b \right) \right)*\left( -1 \right)$$

<p align="right">Remember the chain rule? When $h(x) = f(g(x))$, then $h'(x) =f'(g(x))\cdot g'(x)$</p> 

Each time Gradient Descent use the training set to update each parameter is called an **epoch**. At the first one, we initialize $w\gets 0$ and $b\gets 0$, and at each epoch, the update is given by:

$$ w\gets w - \alpha\frac{\partial l}{\partial x} $$ 

$$ b\gets b - \alpha\frac{\partial l}{\partial b} $$ 

, where $\alpha$ is the **learning rate** (it controls the size of an update).

It is important to understand that, in order to **minimize the objective function**:
- **positive** derivative means the square error **rises**     in such point. Thus the substraction, to move the variable to the left (opposite) direction.
- **negative** derivative means the square error **decreases** in such point. Thus the substraction, to move the variable to the right (opposite) direction.

With the update done, a new epoch is set with the new updated values for **w** and **b**. It's noted that after some epochs those values do not change that much, and that's the time to **stop**.



## MarI/O
In this example, the objective is not to redistribute the code, but to analyse it's functions, solutions and requirements.



Many functions are used to detect where Mario, enemies, platforms or mushrooms are in the state (moment of the game, like a "screenshot" of the situation). The position of everything was approximated into tiles so the learning algorithm could compute faster and simpler decisions, shortening processing times and reducing generations needed to clear the level.

- getPositions(), getTile(dx, dy), getSprites(), getExtendedSprites()

A function of creating a sigmoid shows that the author pretends to use a **standart logistic function** (also known as the **sigmoid function**), which has the property of being a continuous function with a (0,1) codomain. This can be used to easily label the tile configuration, a sort of ON/OFF label.

- sigmoid(x)

## Number Recognition
This example is based on Michael Nielsen's book, "Neural Networks and Deep Learning", available in <http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html>. 

There is a large repository of labeled handwritten numbers called MNIST, and by using a python script "mnist_loader.py" <https://github.com/colah/nnftd/blob/master/code/mnist_loader.py>.

This enables the creation of a machine learning model that can predict learn to read 28x28 pixel images that contains handwritten numbers.

The code contains some functions:

- feedforward(self, a)
Remember about the basics, the function:

$$ f(x) = wx + b $$

that we saw earlier, is the structure of a *perceptron*. What we are using in this example are Sigmoid Neurons, that have the following form:

$$ a' = \sigma (wa + b) $$

and have the output in the codomain [0,1].

- SGD(self, training_data, epochs, mini_batch_size, eta, test_data=None)
Knowing how to feedforward, the function SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) is the muscle of the neural network. It will shuffle the training data, separate into mini batches from the training data, and...

For mini_batch in mini_batches:

- update_mini_batch(self, mini_batch, eta):

Will take the weights & bias per mini batch, and will update them using the backpropagation function.

- backprop(self, x, y):

The backpropagation will use the labels attached to the images, and compare them to the Neural Network's answer. The bigger the error, bigger the update. Notice that in SGD, the updates are done by taking the average of the corrections for each labeled example so the training can be concluded faster. The path to the minima is not as linear as a single batch training, but in terms of computational effort, it is worth it.

- **Some conclusions**:

By plotting the weights, from the first epoch to the last epoch, the colors became more vibrant as the epochs passed, showing that the weights have "matured", and for some fun facts, showing the Hebbian therem: neurons that fire together, wire together (3Blue1Brown citation XD <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ilg3gGewQ5U>).

By each epoch, the success rate climbed up to 95%, which is very impressive. Notice that to achieve this result, the number of neurons in the layers far different from what I first imagined.
